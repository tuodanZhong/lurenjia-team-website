</p>

`dsh-codex-connect` adds the `openai-codex` model catalog and a separate ChatGPT OAuth login. Models run through Harness's normal LLM service, so streaming, tool calls, reasoning replay, compaction, filesystem controls, permission gates, and approval prompts remain Harness-owned. It does not turn a ChatGPT subscription into an OpenAI Platform API credential.

Installation is additive. The bundle does not replace the current default model or search route, and its standalone search provider and `view_image` tool are disabled until explicitly enabled.

Every UI screenshot in this English guide is captured from the English-localized Harness UI. The [Chinese guide](docs/README.zh.md) uses a Chinese capture of the same state. Model and provider identifiers keep their canonical spelling in both languages.

## Quick start (about five minutes)

This guide uses the `web` profile. Replace `web` with the name of the Harness profile you already use. You need a working `dsh` installation; from a DeepSeek Harness source checkout, prefix the commands with `pnpm`.

### 1. Install the plugin into one profile

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-codex-connect@alpha
```

Expected result: the package is added to that profile. This does not change the profile's default model or global search route.

To reproduce this release exactly, use `dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-codex-connect@0.1.0-alpha.4.10`. If npm is unavailable after the matching GitHub prerelease exists, use `dsh plugin --profile web add 'github:franksong2702/dsh-codex-connect#v0.1.0-alpha.4.10'`. A local checkout can be installed as `link:/absolute/path/to/dsh-codex-connect`.

### 2. Start Harness

```sh
dsh web
```

Expected result: the Harness web UI opens for the selected profile.

### 3. Find the Codex Connect card

Open **Settings → Plugins → Plugin configuration → Codex Connect**.

Expected result: a fresh installation shows **Not signed in** and a **Sign in with ChatGPT** button. The card is where you later manage optional capabilities too.

</p>

### 4. Sign in with ChatGPT

Click **Sign in with ChatGPT** and complete the browser approval yourself. Do not copy an authorization URL, code, token, or account identifier into an issue, log, or configuration file.

Expected result: the account area changes to **Signed in**. The screenshot below is the successful end state after this step; it is not the initial sign-in screen.

</p>

### 5. Choose a model and make one safe check

Open Harness's normal model picker and select an `openai-codex` model for the agent or session you are using. This selection is separate from writing the profile's default model or global search route.

The picker groups the available entries under **OpenAI Codex**. Model identifiers such as `GPT-5.6 Luna` are canonical names, so they intentionally remain un-translated.

</p>

To confirm the configured plugin row locally, run:

```sh
dsh --profile web --dump-config
```

Expected result: the configuration has exactly one `llm-openai-codex` row. Keep this configuration dump local; it may include unrelated profile settings.

For secret-free status and diagnostics that do not start OAuth, run:

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web exec dsh-codex-connect status --json
dsh plugin --profile web exec dsh-codex-connect doctor --json
```

Expected result: `status --json` reports `signed-in` and exits `0`, while `doctor --json` prints one secret-free JSON document. A signed-out `status --json` exits `1`; return to step 4 instead of treating that as a plugin failure.

## Optional capabilities (off by default)

The installed bundle is intentionally inert beyond model-provider registration:

```yaml
- id: llm-openai-codex
  config:
    enableSearch: false
    enableImageTool: false
```

Open **Settings → Plugins → Plugin configuration → Codex Connect** to manage the account and these options in one card. **Save changes** affects only this plugin's capability section and applies live. It never selects a default model or a global search route.

### Enable only the capability you intend to use

- `enableSearch: true` registers Codex as an available search provider. It does not select the profile's global search route.
- `enableImageTool: true` enables `view_image` for approved local reads and public-network image fetches on vision-capable models.

The screenshot below is an example after someone has explicitly enabled capabilities. It does not show the fresh-install default. This English guide uses the English-localized capture; the Chinese guide shows the matching Chinese-localized state.

</p>

### Change a default model or global search route separately

To make a Codex model the default for new agents, add or update the separate Harness row yourself:

```yaml
- id: agent-default-model
  config:
    provider: openai-codex
    model: gpt-5.6-sol
```

Selecting Codex as the profile's global search route is another explicit change:

```yaml
- id: llm-openai-codex
  config:
    enableSearch: true
    searchMode: live
    searchContextSize: medium

- id: web
  config:
    searchProvider: openai-codex
```

| Field | Default | Values |
|---|---:|---|
| `enableSearch` | `false` | boolean |
| `enableImageTool` | `false` | boolean |
| `searchModel` | `gpt-5.6-sol` | Codex model id |
| `searchMode` | `cached` | `cached`, `indexed`, `live` |
| `searchContextSize` | `medium` | `low`, `medium`, `high` |
| `searchMaxOutputTokens` | `10000` | positive integer |

## Reauthentication, diagnostics, and conflicts

- If the card says **Sign in again** or the server asks for reauthentication, click that action and complete the same safe browser flow. It preserves this plugin's capability settings and does not silently change your default model or global search route. Do not run `logout` just to renew a session.
- `doctor` reads process and filesystem metadata only. `doctor --json` emits exactly one secret-free JSON document with schema version 1, package/version/Node metadata, credential-file state and safe mode, capabilities, conflict status, and hints. It omits the absolute credential path and OAuth, account, and expiry data.
- `status --json` emits only signed-in or signed-out state with package metadata. `status --json` reads the credential only to determine sign-in state, but never prints credential contents or starts OAuth.
- OAuth is stored separately at `$DSH_HOME/.openai-codex-auth.json` (`~/.dsh` by default). `~/.codex/auth.json` is never copied or modified. The parent directory and file use owner-only permissions where supported, writes are atomic, and refresh writes use a cross-process file lock.
- By default, the OAuth routes accept loopback browser requests only. When DSH runs on one device and you open it from another device on a trusted network, approve the browser address-bar origin explicitly on the device that runs DSH:

  ```sh
  dsh plugin --profile web exec dsh-codex-connect trust-origin http://192.168.1.20:3080
  dsh plugin --profile web exec dsh-codex-connect trusted-origins
  dsh plugin --profile web exec dsh-codex-connect untrust-origin http://192.168.1.20:3080
  ```

  Replace the example with the exact origin from the browser address bar, including scheme and port; do not enter the accessing device's IP, a bare host, a path, a query, or a fragment. Trust only a network you control, never expose this route to the public Internet, and use an SSH tunnel as the fallback when explicit network trust is not appropriate. The browser page only displays and copies this command; it never changes the allowlist itself.
- If startup reports an `openai-codex` collision, an old `dsh-codex` bundle or manual provider row may already own the adapter. Inspect the effective configuration and remove only the confirmed conflicting owner. Do not delete auth files or unrelated providers.
- Removing the package does not delete OAuth state. Run `logout` only when credential removal is intended.

## Compatibility and security boundary

- The only verified compatibility combination is DSH plugin API packages `0.1.0-rc.7`, `@earendil-works/pi-ai` `0.82.1`, and Node.js `^22.19.0 || >=24.0.0`; see [compatibility.json](compatibility.json). Alpha 4.10 uses the rc.7 keyed Plugin configuration slot; DSH rc.6 users should remain on Alpha 4.9.
- Upgrade the DSH plugin API packages and `@earendil-works/pi-ai` as one group, then run `dsh-codex-connect doctor --json` and the compatibility check again. This contract does not make claims about future versions.
- ChatGPT plan eligibility, model access, quotas, and backend behavior are controlled by OpenAI and may change.
- The Codex endpoint does not enforce the ordinary Responses `max_output_tokens` field. Harness compaction still works, but that summary cap cannot be imposed server-side on this route.
- Shell, filesystem, skills, MCP, subagents, approvals, permissions, attachments, session persistence, compaction, and recovery continue to come from the active Harness profile.
- Remote `view_image` URLs are limited to public HTTP(S) destinations. Every DNS result and redirect is checked, and the connection is pinned to the validated address so localhost, private networks, link-local services, and cloud metadata endpoints remain unreachable.
- No real OAuth operation is required for installation, build, tests, doctor, or package validation.
