# DeepSeek Harness Desktop

An unofficial community desktop shell for the public
[DeepSeek Harness](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness) (`dsh`) agent runtime.

### Download

**macOS (Apple Silicon)** — [Disk image][mac-dmg] · [Zip][mac-zip]

Use **v0.1.4**. Developer ID signed and notarized (the `.app` and the `.dmg` wrapper
are both stapled). Closing the window hides to the menu bar; quit from the tray,
Dock, or Cmd+Q. Nothing else to install — the agent runtime and its Node are inside
the download.

**Windows (x64)** — [Installer][win-exe] · [Portable zip][win-zip]

Unsigned, so SmartScreen will warn on first run. The current Windows drop is still 0.1.1.

`dsh` is a command-line agent runtime that also serves a full web UI. This project wraps
that runtime in a desktop application: it starts the kernel as a local child process,
waits until it is genuinely serving, and shows its UI in a hardened window — so the
runtime can be launched by double-clicking rather than from a terminal.

> **Status: early development.** The kernel itself is an upstream developer preview
> (`0.1.0-rc.x`) whose configuration surface is still changing. Windows and macOS
> (Apple Silicon and Intel) are the platforms that have been built end to end; see
> [Roadmap](#roadmap) for the rest.

Everything above is the upstream web UI, served by the kernel and rendered in the shell's
window. The shell contributes the window, the process, and the security policy around
them — not the interface.

## What this is, and what it is not

This repository contains **only the desktop shell**. All agent behaviour — models, tools,
sessions, permissions, the web UI — comes from the upstream kernel and its plugins.

The shell owns four things, and deliberately nothing else:

| Concern | What the shell does |
|---|---|
| **Process** | Starts `dsh` as a child process on a free port, and shuts down the whole process tree on exit. |
| **Readiness** | Waits for a real HTTP response from *this* launch before showing a window. |
| **Window** | Applies a fixed security policy: sandboxed renderer, exact-origin navigation allowlist, `http`/`https`-only external links. |
| **Configuration** | Expresses its preferences as a patch overlay, through the kernel's own supported mechanism, without modifying upstream code. |

Nothing upstream is patched or vendored-and-edited. The kernel is installed from npm at a
pinned version, and every shell preference goes through `--patch`, which is a first-class
part of the launcher's configuration layering.

## Design notes

A few decisions that are easy to get wrong, and why this shell makes them the way it does.

**An open port is not a ready server.** The kernel's web server binds its port during
startup, and a plugin failing afterwards can still bring the process down. In that window
a TCP connection succeeds while nothing is being served, and a window pointed at it shows
a blank page. Readiness therefore requires a real HTTP 2xx/3xx response.

**Readiness is bound to one launch.** Every probe attempt re-checks that the process being
waited on is still the current one. Otherwise a kernel that died and left its port to
another program on the machine would answer the probe perfectly well — with someone else's
server.

**Navigation is compared as an exact origin.** `startsWith('http://127.0.0.1:')` also
matches any other service running locally, and `includes('127.0.0.1')` matches
`http://evil.example/?x=127.0.0.1`. The loaded page decides its own links; the shell does
not get to assume they are benign.

**Secrets are redacted as they enter the log buffer,** not as they leave it. Redacting at
read time still leaves the plaintext sitting in this process's memory until then. The
matching is by shape and cannot be complete — it is a second line of defence, not a
guarantee.

**The kernel gets its own `DSH_HOME`,** and every inherited `DSH_*` variable is dropped.
Sharing a home directory with a `dsh` the user installed themselves would have the two
overwrite each other's configuration, and would put the user's own stored credentials
within reach of this process.

**Telemetry is switched off explicitly.** Upstream already defaults it to disabled; the
shell states it anyway, so the default is a property of this application rather than of
whichever kernel version happens to be bundled.

**The kernel runs on its own bundled Node, not on Electron's.** Those are different
runtimes, and the difference is not theoretical. With an identical kernel and an identical
configuration, launched under Electron-as-Node the kernel aborts during startup:

```
failed to apply loader entry … (@deepseek-ai/cordis-plugin-hmr):
  --expose-internals is required for HMR service
```

and on a stock Node build of the same major version it starts cleanly. Notably this
happens *after* the web server is already answering HTTP — so even a real HTTP response is
not proof that the process will stay up, which is why an unexpected kernel exit is
reported rather than silently leaving a window pointed at nothing.

The bundled runtime is downloaded from nodejs.org, checked against the SHA-256 published
in that release's `SHASUMS256.txt`, and then asked what version it is. Both checks fail the
build rather than warn.

**What ships is not what npm installs.** An npm tree is published for developers: debug
symbols, source maps, the TypeScript the JavaScript was built from, documentation, and
prebuilt binaries for every platform. None of it is opened by a running application, and
all of it would ship to every user — 180 MB of the installed size. `tools/prune-kernel.js`
removes it, keeping licences and notices in every spelling, since redistributing
MIT-licensed code without its licence text is a violation. The end-to-end test runs against
the pruned kernel, so a size win that broke startup fails the build.

## Requirements

**To run a packaged build:** nothing. The kernel and its Node runtime are inside the
installer.

**To develop:** Node.js ≥ 22.15.0 — the kernel uses `zlib.createZstdDecompress`, which does
not exist in earlier versions.

Windows and macOS ship a bundled, checksum-verified Node runtime, so a packaged build has
no external requirements. Linux is expected to work but has not been exercised, and still
falls back to the system Node.

## Development

```sh
npm install          # shell dependencies (Electron, builder, types)
npm test             # unit tests for every load-bearing decision — no network, no Electron
npm run kernel:install   # fetch the pinned kernel into resources/kernel
npm start            # launch the shell against it
npm run dist:mac     # .dmg and .zip (Developer ID + notarize if Apple creds are set)
npm run dist:win     # NSIS installer and .zip for Windows
```

The kernel version is pinned in [`upstream.lock.json`](upstream.lock.json), which is the
single source of truth for it. Upgrading is an explicit commit, not something a rebuild
does on its own — upstream is a developer preview and documents that it will make
breaking changes.

### Layout

Load-bearing *decisions* live in plain modules with no Electron or filesystem imports, so
they can be tested directly:

| Module | Decides |
|---|---|
| `src/window-policy.js` | Where the window may navigate; what may be handed to the OS. |
| `src/kernel-runtime.js` | The kernel's argument vector and environment. |
| `src/readiness.js` | When the kernel counts as ready. |
| `src/log-redact.js` | What may enter the log buffer, and how much is kept. |

`src/main.js` does IO and orchestration only.

## Roadmap

- [x] Kernel launch, argument and environment construction
- [x] Readiness probe bound to a single launch
- [x] Window and navigation security policy
- [x] Bounded, redacted log capture
- [x] Bundled, checksum-verified Node runtime
- [x] Windows installer, verified by launching it and loading the UI
- [x] macOS build (Apple Silicon `.dmg` + `.zip`, Developer ID signed and notarized;
      Intel runtime is pinned but not in the current drop)
- [x] Workspace picker verified working on the bundled runtime — the kernel's native
      Windows picker has been reported to crash under other runtimes; on this build it
      opens, cancels, and leaves the kernel serving. `buildShellPatch({
      useBrowseDirectoryPicker: true })` selects the non-native implementation if a build
      ever needs it, and is off by default
- [ ] Linux builds

### macOS notes

The [v0.1.4](https://github.com/sleep2agi/DeepSeek-Harness-Desktop/releases/tag/v0.1.4)
Apple Silicon build is Developer ID signed; the `.app` and the `.dmg` are notarized and
stapled. Prefer that over v0.1.3 if a downloaded `.dmg` says it is damaged.

A Mac launched from the Dock has a minimal `PATH`. The shell prepends Homebrew's usual
locations (`/opt/homebrew/bin`, `/usr/local/bin`) so the kernel can still find `git` and
the rest of a developer toolchain.

## Independence

Everything here is written from public sources against pinned public dependencies. It does
not copy private product code, and contains no organization-specific branding,
authentication clients, private endpoints, update feeds, credentials, or telemetry. The
`scan:leaks` check in CI enforces this against the working tree and the committed history,
and fails the build rather than warning.
