# dsh-voice

Full-duplex voice mode for DeepSeek Harness: streamed ASR → LLM → TTS with barge-in.

## Status

**v0.5.0 — SenseVoice (sherpa-onnx) host-side ASR.**

Speak into the composer mic: the assistant silences itself (playback stops,
host synthesis queue drops), the running turn is cancelled (the stop-button
route), and your speech is transcribed by the host (SenseVoice, CN-native
simplified-Chinese ASR with punctuation + ITN) and submitted. The reply
streams back as spoken audio with live captions.

Known limitation: barge-in detection is triggered by the mic's leading
speech edge, which relies on browser-level echo cancellation
(`getUserMedia({ echoCancellation: true })`). Loud TTS playback may leak
into the mic on some platforms; there is no JS-level AEC.

## Demo

![dsh-voice demo](docs/demo.gif)

The loop: a user prompt streams back as spoken audio sentence-by-sentence,
then the user's voice interrupts playback and stops the running turn
mid-reply (true barge-in). The mic keeps recording the new speech.

## How it works

```
input:  mic ──RMS endpoint detection──▶ POST /asr (raw f32 PCM)
                                           │ text (SenseVoice)
                                           ▼
        composer draft ──submit──▶ model stream ──llm/stream tap──▶ SentenceSegmenter
                                                                     │
        browser ◀── SSE /dsh-voice-api/stream ── TtsQueue (msedge-tts) ◀──┘
                  (base64 MP3 frames + caption text)

barge-in: speech edge ──▶ engine.skip() + POST /cancel (epoch bump)
                         + session.cancel() when a turn is running
```

- The `llm/stream` tap is **lossless**: every chunk is yielded unchanged, the
  segmenter only observes. The model stream is never blocked by synthesis.
- ASR runs **host-side** with [sherpa-onnx](https://github.com/k2-fsa/sherpa-onnx)
  (Apache-2.0) running **SenseVoice** — the CN-native speech model that
  outperforms whisper on Chinese: native simplified output, punctuation,
  inverse text normalization (ITN) and 50+ language auto-detection. The
  browser only records and posts raw little-endian f32 PCM.
- Model files stream through a **cache-through proxy** at
  `/dsh-voice-api/hf` and are mirrored to disk
  (`~/.cache/dsh-voice/models/`, configurable via `cacheDir`), so every
  browser/recognizer load after the first is served from local disk.
  Downloads resume from partial `.part` files when interrupted. Use
  `npm run prefetch` to warm the cache once.
- RMS endpoint detection: 16kHz getUserMedia, 2s trailing-silence cutoff,
  max 30s segment, pre/post padding. Zero dependencies.
- Barge-in is three-layered: local playback queue cleared, host `TtsQueue`
  epoch bumped (queued AND in-flight synthesis dropped), and the running
  turn cancelled when `session.running` is true. An aborted turn never
  flushes its trailing half-sentence — exactly what the user interrupted.
- `modelHost` accepts any HF-compatible mirror (e.g. `https://hf-mirror.com`
  for CN networks).

## API

| Route | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `GET /dsh-voice-api/stream` | SSE; `event: audio` frames `{sessionId, seq, text, audio(base64 MP3)}` |
| `POST /dsh-voice-api/asr` | raw little-endian f32 PCM body → `{text}` via SenseVoice |
| `POST /dsh-voice-api/cancel` | `{sessionId}` drops queued + in-flight synthesis (epoch bump) |
| `GET /dsh-voice-api/config` | ASR runtime config `{asr: {...}}` for the mic button |
| `GET /dsh-voice-api/hf/*` | cache-through HF model proxy (mirrors to `cacheDir`) |
| `GET /dsh-voice-api/*` | ping: `{ok, name, enabled}` |

Config (bundle patch row):

```yaml
- id: voice
  name: '@haoku123/dsh-voice'
  config:
    voice: zh-CN-XiaoxiaoNeural
    cacheDir: ~/.cache/dsh-voice/models   # optional, on-disk model cache
    asr:
      model: csukuangfj/sherpa-onnx-sense-voice-zh-en-ja-ko-yue-2024-07-17
      modelHost: https://huggingface.co   # or https://hf-mirror.com
      language: auto                      # auto | zh | en | ja | ko | yue
      useItn: true                        # inverse text normalization
      autoSend: false
      mode: toggle                        # toggle | hold
```

Model files are fetched through the proxy on first use; warm the cache once
with the dsh host running:

```sh
npm run prefetch          # uses http://127.0.0.1:3080 by default
```

## Install

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add <repo-url-or-path>
dsh --profile web
```

Note: needs Node ≥ 22.19 or ≥ 24 (`node:zlib` zstd APIs).

## Tests

```sh
npm test                                # segmenter unit tests (pure, no network)
node test/host.integration.test.mjs     # llm/stream tap + real Edge TTS + SSE + /config
node test/bargein.test.mjs              # client inject face wiring (skipPlayback/cancelTurn)
node test/bargein-semantics.test.mjs    # aborted turn no-flush + cancel drops in-flight
node verify-client.mjs                  # client bundle registration/exports/slots/dynamic-import
