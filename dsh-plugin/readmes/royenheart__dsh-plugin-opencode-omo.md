# @royenheart/dsh-plugin-opencode-omo

A DeepSeek Harness plugin that adds an `opencode-omo` agent preset (mode) to the web profile. The mode replicates the behavior of **opencode** + the **omo** plugin ([oh-my-openagent](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/oh-my-openagent)), scoped to this mode only — other presets (`standard`/…) keep the default dsh loop, sandboxed fs, and no omo hooks.

## What the mode provides

- **opencode + omo system prompt** — the real opencode `default.txt` persona (tone, style, proactiveness, conventions, code style, task guidance) + omo's Sisyphus orchestrator identity, declared as the **complete** system prompt: the dsh harness identity and runtime-context snapshot are suppressed for this mode. The loop shim additionally prepends opencode's **live environment block** (exact model id, working dir, workspace root, git, platform, date, recomputed every step).
- **omo role picker in the composer** — in dsh's existing `conversation.input.left` tool-row slot (after the access/plan chips): `sisyphus`, `hephaestus` (Deep Agent), `prometheus` (Plan Builder), `atlas` (Plan Executor), `sisyphus-junior`, `athena`/`athena-junior`/`council-member`, `metis`, `momus`, `oracle`, `librarian`, `explore`, `multimodal-looker`. Selecting a role swaps the session's complete system prompt and applies that role's configured model.
- **Global "Role Settings"** in the dsh settings panel (`settings.section`): per-role primary model dropdown (follow current / fixed) under a centered "Primary model" label; a dsh-style circle "+" button opens a fallback model list below the role box (repeatable additions, cancel/close adds nothing), persisted in `opencode-omo-roles` settings. On request failure the loop shim advances through the role's fallback chain before the harness retry policy runs.
- **opencode toolchain (complete)** — persistent `bash`, `read`/`write`/`edit`/`read_image`, `apply_patch`, `glob`/`grep`, `todo_write`, `skill`, `web_fetch`/`web_search`, `lsp`, `exit_plan_mode` (plan), `ask_user_question`. `tool-surface.mjs` overwrites the model-visible descriptions/parameters with opencode's `tool/*.txt` text and shims `read`/`edit`/`write` to opencode's parameter names.
- **omo `task()` surface** — `task-shim.mjs` registers the omo-style `task(category/subagent_type/load_skills/run_in_background/task_id)` invocation, mapping it onto dsh named subagents + generic delegation.
- **omo multi-role subagents** — `oracle` (read-only advisor), `librarian` (external docs/code search), `explore` (codebase grep), `metis` (pre-planning), `momus` (plan reviewer), `multimodal-looker` (media), plus generic `subagent`/`subagent_fork` + `workflow`/`ralph`.
- **omo context injection** — AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md walk-up + `skills/` + omo's `rules-injector` (`.omo/rules`, `.cursor/rules`, `.github/instructions`, `copilot-instructions.md`).
- **omo hooks** — `comment-checker` (rejects AI-slop comments on write/edit), `hashline` (read tagging `N#HH|content` + `hashline_edit` stale-ref guard).
- **per-mode execution backend** — local filesystem (`dsh-fs-local`) + persistent PTY shell, isolated from other modes' sandboxed fs/shell.
- **native-seam loop shim** — no dsh-side driver seam. `driver.mjs` is an ordinary preset plugin using the shipped seams: a dynamic `ctx.systemPrompt.section({ complete: true })` recomputes opencode's env block and the selected omo role prompt per assembly; `system-prompt/assemble` applies opencode's model tool gating; `agent/inbox/claimed`, `agent/pre-step`, `agent/request`, and `agent/request-error` provide ultrawork detection, maxSteps, role model routing, and fallback retry. Other presets are untouched by construction.

```

## Install

`lib/` is generated locally and is not committed. `install.py` always builds the repository's own toolchain first (`npm install` when the toolchain is missing, then `npm run build`) and only reports an error when npm itself is missing:

```sh
python3 install.py install --profile web              # install (idempotent)
python3 install.py uninstall --profile web            # remove
```

`install.py` symlinks the package into `~/.dsh/profiles/<profile>/node_modules/`, edits the profile's `package.json` (adds/removes the dependency + bundle entry), and publishes the preset through dsh's native user preset root as a real directory under `$DSH_HOME/.agent-presets/opencode-omo` (entries symlinked into the package, so updates stay live):

Manual alternative — the package is a dsh **bundle**: it declares `dsh.bundle.patch` and ships the preset. `dsh plugin` reconciles `dsh.profile.bundles` from the installed package automatically:

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add link:/path/to/dsh-plugin-opencode-omo
```

The preset still needs its user-root publication (the bundle patch cannot create `$DSH_HOME/.agent-presets` entries):

```sh
mkdir -p "$DSH_HOME/.agent-presets/opencode-omo"
for f in /path/to/dsh-plugin-opencode-omo/presets/opencode-omo/*; do
  ln -s "$f" "$DSH_HOME/.agent-presets/opencode-omo/"
done
```

Restart dsh and select **opencode-omo** from the mode picker.

**Optional LSP server.** The preset preconfigures `typescript-language-server` for the `lsp` tool. `install.py` checks `PATH` and warns when it is missing; the preset then self-disables its `lsp-stdio` row so the mode still mounts (LSP queries fail gracefully instead of blocking the whole preset). Install it to enable LSP:

```sh
npm install -g typescript-language-server typescript
```

then restart dsh.

**web_fetch provider.** The preset enables dsh's native `web_fetch` tool, so the bundle patch also registers the native HTTP fetch provider (`@deepseek-ai/dsh-web-fetch-http`) into the shared `ctx.web`; `install.py` links that package into the profile module tree. `web_search` keeps using the existing DeepSeek search provider (`DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`). Other presets keep `fetch: false`, so their tool surface is unchanged.

## Required dsh-side changes

**This release depends on one dsh-side patch.** Apply it to deepseek-harness for full maxSteps fidelity; the patches are under [`patches/`](patches/README.md), split by feature:

- `patches/0001-agent-pre-step-assistant-prefill.patch` — adds optional `assistantPrefill` to `PreStepDecision`; the loop appends it to the request after the derived history and logs it on `request/header` (request-only, never a session message). The plugin uses it to restore opencode's `MAX_STEPS_PROMPT` assistant-role semantics. **Runtime compatibility**: the host plugin scans the installed `@deepseek-ai/dsh-agent-loop` bundle for the compiled `assistantPrefill` marker. When the patch is absent, maxSteps automatically degrades to an equivalent synthetic user message (nothing is silently dropped) and the `/roles` response carries the warning to the browser; the web client shows it once per page load via the native `@deepseek-ai/dsh-client-ui-primitives` `Toast` (4 seconds, non-blocking).

```sh
cd /path/to/deepseek-harness
git apply /path/to/dsh-plugin-opencode-omo/patches/0001-agent-pre-step-assistant-prefill.patch
npm run build:lib:host
npx vitest run packages/core/agent-loop/tests/interception.spec.ts
```

- Provider-visible `format`/`toolChoice` is still a proposal (see `DSH_CHANGE_PROPOSALS.md`); omo's regular path does not use it and the standalone structured-output plugin covers the common route.

Everything else runs on unmodified dsh seams: the preset is published through `$DSH_HOME/.agent-presets` and the composer picker occupies the existing `conversation.input.left` slot (the client registers through `ctx.slots.inject()`, so it waits for the declaring parent regardless of out-of-tree bundle apply order).

## Bench experiments (equivalence validation)

Runners and reproduction notes live in [`tests/benches/`](tests/benches/README.md); reports are written to `docs/exps/`. The scientific methodology (paired design, McNemar/bootstrap/TOST, A/A noise floor, trace alignment, cache and latency protocols) is documented in [`docs/exps/2026-08-16-scientific-bench-methodology.md`](docs/exps/2026-08-16-scientific-bench-methodology.md). Design highlights:

- Run an isolated-port dsh (`opencode-omo` mode, isolated `$DSH_HOME`) and the machine's installed opencode + oh-my-openagent (isolated `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`).
- Both use `deepseek-official/deepseek-v4-pro` (dpsk v4 pro); the API key comes from the `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` environment variable. Scripts hardcode no machine paths or secrets.
- Tiered benches: L1 HumanEval, L2 MBPP, L3 SWE-bench-verified-mini (sampled), comparing pass@1, CoT/reasoning exposure, tool-call chains (read/edit/write/bash/test/subagents), and final patches/answers.
- Performance: `bench_metrics.mjs` normalizes token usage (including `cacheRead`) and tool timestamps on both sides; `eval_perf.mjs` / `eval_swe_perf.mjs` produce cache hit rate, TTFT, step duration, and per-tool timing offline (see report §5).
- **MBPP fix**: MBPP rows have no `entry_point`; the scripts infer the function name from the first `assert fn(...)` or the reference `def fn`. The old implementation hardcoded `Function name: undefined`, which was the root cause of MBPP behavioral divergence (see report §0 and §6.4).
- Raw bench data is downloaded to `tests/benches/.data/` and is **not versioned**; `fetch-benches.sh` reproduces the downloads and `setup-homes.sh` reproduces both isolated homes.

### Latest results (dpsk v4 pro; L1 30×3, corrected L2 5×2, legacy L3 sample)

| level | dsh pass@1 | opencode+omo pass@1 | per-item agreement |
|---|---|---|---|
| HumanEval (30 tasks × 3 repeats) | 1.00 | 1.00 | 1.00 |
| MBPP (corrected entry_point, 5 tasks × 2 repeats) | 1.00 | 1.00 | 1.00 |
| SWE-bench-verified-mini sample (`sphinx-doc__sphinx-10323`) | same patch | same patch | byte-identical git diff |

## Alignment status (audited against reference/opencode + reference/oh-my-openagent)

- **Aligned**: opencode default persona (complete system prompt + live env block whose provider/model now follow the same per-step route as the actual request — session live model selection or the role primary/fallback — so prompt and request cannot split; workspace root now derived as the git root); opencode tool families + gpt apply_patch/edit-write tool gating enforced on BOTH the model-visible schema and execution (`tools/pre-execute` deny mirror); opencode maxSteps + verbatim MAX_STEPS_PROMPT; verbatim opencode plan.txt / plan-mode.txt with dynamic `${planInfo}` and the plan→build BUILD_SWITCH reminder; omo role catalog/display names; sisyphus/hephaestus/atlas/sisyphus-junior + specialist subagents; comment-checker/hashline/rules-injector hooks; generated Sisyphus routing sections; extracted omo Sisyphus model-family templates (GPT-5.5/GPT-5.4/claude-opus-4-7/claude-opus-4-8/claude-fable-5/gemini/kimi-k3/kimi-k2-7/kimi-k2-6/glm-5-2, with the dynamic Sisyphus fallback for unknown families) plus hephaestus GPT variants, all 8 atlas variants, and specialist model variants (oracle/metis/momus); omo-default per-role PRIMARY model resolution (provider-scope ordered) and fallback chains that start AFTER the primary; omo role sampling defaults (sisyphus/hephaestus GPT effort medium, atlas temperature 0.1); omo-style retryable-error gating before fallback advance; reasoning-effort selectors in role settings; ultrawork keyword override; `/start-work`, `/remove-ai-slops`, `/refactor`, `/stop-continuation`, `/handoff`, `/hyperplan`, `/team-mode` commands; composer role picker + global per-role model/fallback settings; omo skills published as `user-dsh` so the third-party skills-manager can manage them. The omo rules-injector text is now folded into the complete system prompt (`driver.mjs` + `rules.mjs`) instead of being dropped by `suppressRuntimeContext()`; approved plans are persisted at `.opencode/plans/<created>-<session>.md`; specialist subagent personas now load the extracted reference prompt files (oracle/librarian/explore/metis/momus/multimodal-looker).
- **MCP**: separate plugin [`dsh-plugin-mcp-support`](../dsh-plugin-mcp-support) mounts native `@deepseek-ai/dsh-mcp-client` servers from its bundle-row config or the persisted `mcp-support` settings namespace.
- **Structured output**: separate plugin [`dsh-plugin-structured-output`](../dsh-plugin-structured-output) provides opencode-style `/json-schema` + `StructuredOutput` validation on native seams (no dsh-side format field). Its visibility is opt-in per preset via Settings → 结构化输出工具 (Structured output); no mode is enabled by default.
- **Partial**: extracted family templates keep dynamic sections filled by dsh-native data rather than omo's builder output; structured output is tool-enforced rather than `tool_choice: required`; hooks are regex/simplified ports; AGENTS.md injection is dsh-native; child subagents inherit the session model because dsh child headers/descriptors do not carry the subagent role id (primary-role sampling defaults ARE applied).
- **Requires one dsh-side patch (see `patches/`, audited 2026-08-15)**: `PreStepDecision.assistantPrefill` for opencode's MAX_STEPS_PROMPT. Provider-visible `format`/`toolChoice` remains a proposal; omo's regular path does not use it and the standalone structured-output plugin covers the common route.

## Remaining gaps

1. **dsh-side (patch provided)**: `PreStepDecision.assistantPrefill`. Without the `patches/` patch the maxSteps prompt is degraded to a synthetic user message; after applying the patch this gap is closed.
2. **dsh-side (proposal, medium)**: `GenerateOptions.format` / `toolChoice`. omo's regular path does not use them; the standalone structured-output plugin covers the common route.
3. Child subagent per-role sampling cannot reliably resolve the role id (dsh child headers/descriptors do not carry it); primary-role sampling defaults ARE applied and children inherit the session model.
4. Plan files: dsh itself does not persist them; the plugin writes `.opencode/plans/*` after `exit_plan_mode` approval. A first-class plan-file seam remains an optional improvement.
5. team-mode TUI, comment-checker CLI, and hashline diff enhancer remain non-LLM/editing experience differences.
