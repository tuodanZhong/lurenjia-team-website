> **npm:** `dsh-vision-bridge-dsh` · **source/GitHub:** `AbdullahElTiby/dsh-vision-bridge`
> (the npm package is named `dsh-vision-bridge-dsh` because the shorter name
> was already taken on npm).

Host-plane plugin that gives **text-only models** (DeepSeek and any provider route
that does not declare `image` input) the ability to "see" images, using a
**pluggable vision provider** as the eyes: **Gemini**, **Groq**, or any
**OpenAI-compatible endpoint** (OpenAI, OpenRouter, Ollama, LM Studio, …).

## What it does

1. **Dispatch interception** — the two LLM dispatch entry points are wrapped:
   `llm.prepareCall` (the agent loop's prepared-call path, used for main
   turns and subagents) and `llm.stream` (session titles, compaction,
   unprepared loops). Before the adapter stream is built, every image block in
   the conversation is described by the configured vision provider and
   replaced with a `[Image (mediaType, WxH): …]` text block. The session
   history and UI keep the real image; only the model request is rewritten.
   This works for every text-only route (`deepseek-official`, pi-ai providers
   such as `opencode-go`, …). Routes that genuinely declare image input are
   passed through untouched.

   **Why method patching instead of the `llm/stream` waterfall:** in this
   harness build the waterfall ignores arguments passed to `next()` (listeners
   always receive the original args) and `dsh-llm`'s default handler closes
   over the original options object. A waterfall listener can wrap the chunk
   stream but can never replace the request the adapter receives — a
   waterfall-only bridge silently loses its rewrite and the text-only adapter
   throws `UNSUPPORTED_CONTENT` ("… does not support image input"). Wrapping
   the service methods makes the rewritten request reach the adapter.

2. **Image admission** — `llm.resolveModelInfo` is patched so bridged routes
   also report `image` input. This admits image uploads in chat, model
   switches with images already in the session, and the built-in `read_image`
   tool for text-only routes (its image blocks are described by the bridge on
   the next model call).
3. **`describe_image` tool** — the model can inspect an image file on disk
   (PNG/JPG/JPEG/WebP/GIF) on demand; useful for screenshot and file analysis.
4. **System-prompt section** — the model is told images arrive as descriptions.

Descriptions are cached per attachment, so history images are described once
per session, not on every model call.

## Installation

The plugin runs inside the DeepSeek Harness (DSH) **web profile**. Both install
paths below need Node ≥ 20 + pnpm, the DSH web app run once (so the profile
folder exists), and an API key for one vision provider (Gemini, Groq, or an
OpenAI-compatible endpoint).

| Path | For | What it is |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Option A — automated](#option-a--automated-install-give-your-ai-a-prompt) | Anyone with an AI assistant | Paste one small prompt; your AI fetches the repo, installs, configures and verifies everything for you |
| [Option B — manual](#option-b--manual-install-step-by-step) | Humans | The same install, explained step by step |

AI agents working in this repo should also read [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md), which
restates the install facts in agent-friendly form.

### Option A — Automated install (give your AI a prompt)

Copy the prompt below and paste it into any AI assistant that can run shell
commands on this machine (a DSH agent, Claude, Codex, …). The AI will fetch
the repo docs, install the package, register the plugin row, set up the
credential and verify the result — you only supply the vision-provider API
key when it asks for it.

> ```text
> Install the dsh-vision-bridge plugin into the DeepSeek Harness (DSH) web
> profile on this machine.
>
> Plugin: npm `dsh-vision-bridge-dsh`, source github.com/AbdullahElTiby/dsh-vision-bridge.
> It gives text-only models (e.g. DeepSeek) vision via a Gemini, Groq, or
> OpenAI-compatible provider.
>
> Procedure:
> 1. Fetch the install docs from the repo (README.md → Installation, and
>    AGENTS.md → "Installing this plugin into a harness") and follow them.
>    If you don't have the repo locally, fetch those files from GitHub.
> 2. Install the package into the DSH web profile (~/.dsh/profiles/web):
>    `pnpm add dsh-vision-bridge-dsh` (or `dsh plugin --profile web add
>    dsh-vision-bridge-dsh`).
> 3. Register the `vision-bridge` row in cordis.patch.yml (default provider:
>    Gemini). Skip this if the row already exists.
> 4. Make sure a GEMINI_API_KEY credential exists (env var or
>    ~/.dsh/.credentials.yaml). If no key is set, ASK ME for it — never
>    invent or reuse a key without asking.
> 5. Verify: `dsh --profile web --dump-config` must show the vision-bridge
>    row.
> 6. Report what you did, whether a key is still needed, and how I can check
>    it works (attach an image in a chat with a text-only model).
>
> Every step must be idempotent and safe to re-run. If I ask for Groq or an
> OpenAI-compatible provider instead of Gemini, use the matching row config
> and credential ref from the Providers table in the README.
> ```

What the AI will run — the exact idempotent commands per OS — is documented in
[`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) § "Installing this plugin into a harness (agent
instructions)", so you can review what it did (or run the same steps yourself).

Final functional check: attach an image in a chat with a text-only model
(e.g. a DeepSeek route) — it should be described instead of rejected with
`UNSUPPORTED_CONTENT`.

### Option B — Manual install (step by step)

#### 1. Install the package

The package is installed into your web profile's `node_modules`. From the
profile directory, add the npm package:

```sh
cd ~/.dsh/profiles/web
dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-vision-bridge-dsh
```

or via pnpm directly:

```sh
cd ~/.dsh/profiles/web
pnpm add dsh-vision-bridge-dsh
```

(As a fallback you can also install straight from GitHub with
`pnpm add github:AbdullahElTiby/dsh-vision-bridge`, or copy the package
folder into `~/.dsh/profiles/node_modules/` — the user-owned module
fallback.)

#### 2. Register the plugin row

Edit `~/.dsh/profiles/web/cordis.patch.yml` and add one of the rows below.
Gemini (the default provider):

```yaml
- insert:
    - id: vision-bridge
      name: 'dsh-vision-bridge'
      config:
        provider: gemini            # optional: gemini is the default
        model: gemini-2.5-flash     # optional
        apiKeyRef: GEMINI_API_KEY   # optional
```

Groq (free tier, vision-capable models — see the table below):

```yaml
- insert:
    - id: vision-bridge
      name: 'dsh-vision-bridge'
      config:
        provider: groq
        model: qwen/qwen3.6-27b     # vision-capable on the free tier
        apiKeyRef: GROQ_API_KEY
```

Any OpenAI-compatible endpoint:

```yaml
- insert:
    - id: vision-bridge
      name: 'dsh-vision-bridge'
      config:
        provider: openai
        baseURL: https://openrouter.ai/api/v1
        model: <vision model id of that endpoint>
        apiKeyRef: OPENROUTER_API_KEY
```

#### 3. Set your API key

Add the key to `~/.dsh/.credentials.yaml` (or export the env var):

```yaml
GEMINI_API_KEY: your-gemini-key
GROQ_API_KEY: your-groq-key      # gsk_… from console.groq.com/keys
```

Auth-free local endpoints (Ollama, LM Studio) still need a credential ref to
be *present* — put any placeholder in it, e.g. `OPENAI_API_KEY: ollama`; the
bridge sends it as a bearer token the local server ignores.

#### 4. Restart

Close and reopen DSH (`dsh web`). You can confirm the row mounts by dumping
the composed config: `dsh --profile web --dump-config`.

To verify it works, attach an image in a chat with a text-only model (e.g. a
DeepSeek route) — it should be described instead of rejected with
`UNSUPPORTED_CONTENT`.

#### Enable/disable

Remove the `vision-bridge` row from `cordis.patch.yml` to disable the feature
(hot-reloaded); delete the package folder to remove it permanently. See the
[Notes](#notes) section for how edits to the plugin code are — and are not —
hot-reloaded.

## Providers

| `provider` | API | default `model` | default `apiKeyRef` | default `baseURL`/`endpoint` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `gemini` (default) | Google Generative Language `generateContent` | `gemini-2.5-flash` | `GEMINI_API_KEY` | `https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta` |
| `groq` | Groq chat completions (OpenAI-compatible) | `qwen/qwen3.6-27b` | `GROQ_API_KEY` | `https://api.groq.com/openai/v1` |
| `openai` | any OpenAI-compatible chat completions | `gpt-4o-mini` | `OPENAI_API_KEY` | `https://api.openai.com/v1` |

`model`, `apiKeyRef` and `baseURL` on the row override the per-provider
defaults. `endpoint` is the legacy name of `baseURL` and still works for the
Gemini transport; for `groq`/`openai`, `baseURL` wins over `endpoint`.

### Groq free tier — which models can see? (live-verified)

Tested against the live API with a real PNG: on the free plan **exactly one
chat model accepts images**:

| model | vision | free limits (RPM / RPD / TPM / TPD) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `qwen/qwen3.6-27b` | ✅ multimodal (vision + text), thinking + non-thinking modes — **default for `provider: groq`** | 30 / 1K / 8K / 200K |
| `openai/gpt-oss-20b` / `openai/gpt-oss-120b` | ❌ served **text-only** on Groq — the API rejects `image_url` parts with `messages[1].content must be a string` | 30 / 1K / 8K / 200K |
| `llama-3.1-8b-instant`, `llama-3.3-70b-versatile` | ❌ text-only (same `content must be a string` rejection) | — |
| `groq/compound(-mini)`, `llama-prompt-guard-2-*`, `openai/gpt-oss-safeguard-20b` | ❌ compound/moderation models, no image description | — |
| `whisper-large-v3(-turbo)`, `canopylabs/orpheus-*` | ❌ audio (STT / TTS) | — |

Pointing the bridge at a non-vision model surfaces a
`description unavailable: groq HTTP 400 …` placeholder — only
`qwen/qwen3.6-27b` works for vision on the free tier.

**Free-plan budget (measured live):** each image call on
`qwen/qwen3.6-27b` charges ~2.7K against the 8K TPM bucket (the reported
usage is ~1.3K prompt tokens, but Groq bills an image floor) — so expect
roughly **3 image descriptions per minute**, 1000 per day (RPD), 30 per
minute max (RPM). Rate-limit responses carry Groq's `x-ratelimit-*`
headers; `npm run test:groq` prints them.

## Configuration (row config on the `vision-bridge` row)

| key | default | meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `provider` | `gemini` | vision transport: `gemini`, `groq`, or `openai` |
| `model` | per provider (see table) | vision model id |
| `apiKeyRef` | per provider (see table) | credential ref (env var / `~/.dsh/.credentials.yaml` / `.env`) |
| `baseURL` | per provider (see table) | API base URL (chat completions for `groq`/`openai`; the Gemini endpoint for `gemini`) |
| `endpoint` | per provider (see table) | legacy alias for `baseURL` (Gemini rows keep using it) |
| `maxOutputTokens` | `1024` | description length cap |
| `reasoningEffort` | `none` for `groq`, unset otherwise | reasoning effort sent to the endpoint (`reasoning_effort`); `none` keeps qwen out of thinking mode so descriptions come back without a `<think>…</think>` block |
| `temperature` | `0.4` | sampling temperature |
| `timeoutMs` | `30000` | per-call timeout |
| `maxImageBytes` | `15728640` | largest image sent to the vision provider |
| `admitImages` | `true` | patch `resolveModelInfo` (image admission) |
| `tool` | `true` | register `describe_image` |
| `systemSection` | `true` | contribute the prompt section |
| `cacheSize` | `256` | description cache size |

Set `admitImages: false` to keep the stock gates (images are then rejected for
text-only models and the bridge never fires).

## Enabling the key

The bridge reads the credential referenced by `apiKeyRef` through the harness
credential layers (inherited environment wins, then
`~/.dsh/.credentials.yaml`, then `.env`). For example, add to
`~/.dsh/.credentials.yaml`:

```yaml
GEMINI_API_KEY: sk-…
GROQ_API_KEY: gsk-…
```

Without a key, attached images are replaced with a short failure placeholder
and a warning is logged; the conversation keeps working.

## Notes

- The package lives in `~/.dsh/profiles/node_modules/` (the deployment's
  user-owned module fallback, alongside the auto-created package links) so it
  survives npx-cache refreshes. Reinstalling the profile via `pnpm install`
  may prune that directory; re-create the package afterwards.
- The `llm.prepareCall` / `llm.stream` / `llm.resolveModelInfo` patches are
  applied per process start by the plugin itself (no shipped package is
  modified) and are removed when the row stops or reloads.
- Code changes to this package are NOT hot-reloaded: the loader re-imports
  rows only when their `name` changes, the HMR watcher ignores
  `**/node_modules`, and config-only row updates reuse the already-loaded
  module. **Restart the harness (close and reopen the app) after editing
  `lib/index.js`.**
- Remove the `vision-bridge` row from `~/.dsh/profiles/web/cordis.patch.yml`
  to disable the feature (hot-reloaded), or delete the package to remove it
  permanently.
