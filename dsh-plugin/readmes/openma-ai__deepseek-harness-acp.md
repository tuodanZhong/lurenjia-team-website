The adapter composes the harness **in-process** and maps its session-event log
onto the full ACP vocabulary: streamed text and reasoning, tool calls with
diffs and display terminals, plans, permission requests, session modes,
config options, slash commands, skills, and MCP servers. Credentials never
touch your editor config — it reuses the key you saved in the dsh Web UI, or
`dsh-acp login` saves one to the same store.

## Two entry points, one embeddable plugin

| | **A · dsh profile plugin (recommended)** | **B · Standalone server** |
|---|---|---|
| Best for | Normal installation and upgrades | Connecting an ACP client without managing a dsh profile |
| Install | `dsh plugin --profile acp add @openma/deepseek-harness-acp@latest` | `npm i -g @openma/deepseek-harness-acp` |
| Zed runs | `dsh --profile acp` | `dsh-acp` |
| Harness | The dsh that owns the profile | Your installed dsh — or the npm-installed peer when none exists |
| Composition | dsh-base + this bundle + your profile's own patches | dsh-base + this bundle (profile machinery booted in-process) |

Both shapes share `$DSH_HOME`: the same credential store, settings, presets,
and session logs as `dsh web` — conversations started in the Web UI can be
listed and loaded from the editor.

Other dsh surfaces can mount the transport-independent
`@openma/deepseek-harness-acp/plugin` on their Base Host tree and own the
transport adapter. The TUI profile uses this path: it starts a separate TUI
Client process and connects ACP over that process's standard stdin/stdout; it
does not start `dsh-acp` or use an in-process Client stream.

The package is therefore not only a CLI wrapper. It is also the ACP surface
plugin used by other dsh applications: one Host composition can expose the
same sessions, tools, presets, skills, and persistence through a transport
chosen by the surface.

### A · dsh profile plugin (recommended)

```bash
npm install -g @deepseek-ai/dsh
dsh web                                                    # save your API key once
dsh plugin --profile acp add @openma/deepseek-harness-acp@latest
```

```jsonc
// Zed settings.json
{
  "agent_servers": {
    "DeepSeek Harness": { "command": "dsh", "args": ["--profile", "acp"] }
  }
}
```

The plugin command creates `$DSH_HOME/profiles/acp`, installs or upgrades the
adapter, and registers its `dsh.bundle` patch. The bridge mounts over
`@deepseek-ai/dsh-base` — the same product baseline as `dsh web`, with the
module-reload watcher off. Extend the profile in
`$DSH_HOME/profiles/acp/cordis.patch.yml` like any other dsh profile. A global
`dsh-acp` installation is not required for this path.

### B · Standalone server

```bash
npm install -g @openma/deepseek-harness-acp
dsh-acp login        # interactive; or save the key in the dsh Web UI
```

```jsonc
// Zed settings.json
{
  "agent_servers": {
    "DeepSeek Harness": { "command": "dsh-acp" }
  }
}
```

The standalone binary finds DeepSeek Harness via `--dsh-path` / `DSH_PATH`,
its own tree, `./node_modules`, `dsh` on PATH, or `npm root -g`. It ships an
npm-installed harness peer as the **last** candidate, so it still prefers the
dsh you installed. When a real `$DSH_HOME/profiles/acp` exists, that profile
owns the composition.

## Plugin and extension model

There are two independent ways to extend an ACP-backed surface.

### Extend the Host composition

The ACP adapter rides the Cordis tree that the profile already owns. Add dsh
plugins to that profile to change the agent composition instead of forking the
ACP server: providers and models join the live catalog, commands and skills
join the advertised session surface, tools and subagents appear through
standard `session/update`, and the same session persistence remains available
to every surface.

For applications embedding ACP, the public package entries are:

| Export | Role |
|---|---|
| `@openma/deepseek-harness-acp/plugin` | Complete Host-side surface plugin. It fills the ACP-required Host services that Base leaves to a surface and provides `ctx.acpServer`. It does not claim a transport. |
| `@openma/deepseek-harness-acp/server` | Lower-level transport-independent `acpServer` provider for a Host tree that already supplies the injected composition services. |
| `@openma/deepseek-harness-acp/stdio` | Standard profile adapter: connects `ctx.acpServer` to process stdin/stdout. |
| `@openma/deepseek-harness-acp/bridge` | Node stream adapter and compatibility entry for older profile patches. |

`ctx.acpServer.connect(stream)` creates a connection-owned bridge fiber over
the existing Host composition. The transport owner retains process, stream,
and TTY lifecycle; the ACP plugin retains session and agent semantics. This is
the shape used by
[`@openma/deepseek-harness-tui`](https://github.com/openma-ai/deepseek-harness-tui):
ACP stays on the Base Host tree while a separate TUI Client process owns its
own Cordis tree.

Adding a Cordis service does not automatically invent a wire method. Prefer a
standard ACP capability or event projection whenever one exists; add an
adapter only for behavior that must cross the client boundary.

### Extend ACP without breaking ordinary clients

Optional wire behavior follows ACP's extension conventions:

1. Advertise support in `initialize` metadata, with a namespaced and versioned
   capability such as `_meta.dsh.cordis.protocol`.
2. Carry annotations on standard messages in namespaced `_meta` fields when no
   new request is needed.
3. Name custom JSON-RPC requests and notifications with a leading underscore,
   and send them only after both peers negotiated the matching capability.
4. Keep the standard ACP path complete. A client that does not advertise an
   extension must still get normal sessions, prompts, updates, cancellation,
   auth, and config options.

The current package applies this pattern to the built-in `_dsh/cordis/*`
family used by the TUI for Client capability discovery, dynamic Package
lifecycle, and package-private Host/Client RPC. It is an explicit, versioned
extension—not a synchronization of Cordis plugin ids, fibers, or `inject`
across processes. The bridge's internal method registry is not currently a
public arbitrary-extension API; new extension families should first define a
stable capability, ownership, lifecycle, and fallback contract.

## Authentication

No keys in editor config, no secrets pasted into chat. ACP clients follow
the protocol: `initialize` advertises three **Agent Auth** methods.

1. **API key** — `api-key`, or `api-key:<provider>` when more than one
   route is live. The client may pass `_meta["api-key"].apiKey`.
2. **Browser** — `browser`. The adapter opens a localhost sign-in page;
   the secret never travels over ACP. Hidden when `NO_BROWSER` is set.
3. **Custom gateway** — `gateway`, only when the client opts in with
   `clientCapabilities.auth._meta.gateway === true`. The client sends
   `_meta.gateway` `{ baseUrl, headers, providerName? }`.

The adapter writes credentials to the harness store. Missing credentials
fail `session/new` and `session/prompt` with `auth_required` (`-32000`).
Logout is the ACP `logout` method.

1. **Harness credential store** — `$DSH_HOME/.credentials.yaml` (mode 600),
   the file the dsh Web UI writes; hot-reloaded. Save a key with
   `dsh-acp login [--provider <route>]`, or the Web UI (Settings → Models).
2. **Process environment** — `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` / `DEEPSEEK_BASE_URL` (and
   the matching `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` / `OPENAI_API_KEY` for those routes) in
   the environment that launches the agent.

The credential gate is the **current provider route**. An Anthropic-only
store is enough for an Anthropic session; a DeepSeek key does not unlock
another provider.

## Features

- **Streaming** — assistant text and reasoning deltas; assembled-message fallback.
- **Images** — `promptCapabilities.image` is advertised when the composition mounts `ctx.attachments` (dsh-base does). ACP `image` blocks are validated, stored with `saveImage`, and kept in wire order with surrounding text. `resource_link` stays a textual file pointer.
- **Tool calls** — ACP kinds, human titles, file locations, real diffs from fs-tool hunks, raw input/output; command output on a **display terminal** when the client supports one, fenced output otherwise.
- **Permission presets as session modes** — `read-only` / `workspace-write` / `danger-full-access`, each a named `{sandbox, approval}` pair recorded as a durable session fact (also exposed as a config option for clients that only render those).
- **Agent composition** — when the profile mounts `agentPresets`, an uncategorized config option `id: "agent"` lists the roster (`standard` / `code` / `minimal` / `cordis`, plus user copies). Switching rebuilds the agent live with history preserved. Authoring (copy/rm) stays on the Web settings page; there is no `/preset` slash.
- **Live model catalog** — providers × models from the running composition (third-party providers added in the Web UI appear immediately), plus reasoning-effort selection that follows your product default.
- **Slash commands** — adapter built-ins (`/status`, `/model`) plus the harness command registry (`/compact`, `/goal`, `/permission`, `/plan`, …) executed without a model turn, plus **skills** (`/skill-name` — the harness's own invocation gesture). Login and logout are ACP methods, not chat commands.
- **Plans & usage** — `todo_write` snapshots as ACP plans; token accounting as `usage_update` and per-turn usage.
- **Sessions** — `session/load` with full history replay, `session/list`, silent restore when a client prompts an old session after an agent restart, titles as `session_info_update`.
- **MCP servers** — per-session `mcpServers` mount `@deepseek-ai/dsh-mcp-client` instances (stdio + streamable HTTP); tools join as `mcp__<server>__<tool>`; a failing server never takes the session down.
- **Real cancellation** — `session/cancel` interrupts the live turn through the harness agent.

## Configuration

Flags win over environment variables, which win over defaults. All optional —
with no flags, sessions follow your product defaults (`settings.yaml`).

| Flag | Env | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `--dsh-path` | `DSH_PATH` | auto-detect | DeepSeek Harness installation |
| `--provider` | `DSH_PROVIDER` | product default | Provider route override |
| `--model` | `DSH_MODEL` | product default | Model override |
| `--max-tokens` | `DSH_MAX_TOKENS` | provider default | Per-request output-token cap |
| `--permission-mode` | `DSH_PERMISSION_MODE` | `workspace-write` | Initial permission preset |
| `--reasoning-effort` | `DSH_REASONING_EFFORT` | product default | `off` / `high` / `max` |
| — | `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` | — | API credential (fallback to the credential store) |
| — | `DEEPSEEK_BASE_URL` | DeepSeek endpoint | OpenAI-compatible endpoint override |
| — | `DSH_ACP_DEBUG` | off | Verbose stderr diagnostics |

Subcommands: `dsh-acp login [api-key]` (interactive when omitted; input never
echoes), `dsh-acp update` (self-update via npm).

## Permissions and sandboxing

Sessions start in `workspace-write`: bash and file mutations are confined to
the session's `cwd` (plus shared temp roots), and a model retry requesting
wider access raises an ACP permission request. **Always allow (this
session)** flips the approval policy to `never` for that session.
`danger-full-access` disables both the sandbox and the prompts — use it only
in disposable checkouts or containers. Each level is one durable preset
(sandbox + approval together), the same three the Web UI offers.

## Architecture

```
ACP client (Zed, …)
   │  ACP JSON-RPC over stdio
   ▼
dsh-acp
   ├─ src/profile-boot.ts     boots the harness's own profile machinery
   │                          (dsh-base + this bundle + $DSH_HOME layers)
   ├─ src/harness.ts          host discovery (DSH_PATH → cwd → PATH → npm -g → npm peer)
   └─ src/bridge/             the ACP bridge (a cordis plugin)
        ├─ index.ts           sessions, prompts, cancel, modes, options,
        │                     commands, credentials, MCP mounts
        ├─ translate.ts       session-event → ACP update projection (pure)
        ├─ history.ts         stored-log replay for session/load (pure)
        └─ prompt.ts          ACP prompt blocks → harness content blocks (pure)
   ▼
your @deepseek-ai/dsh installation   (agent spine, llm, persistence, sandbox,
                                      tools, presets, skills, compaction, …)
```

When embedded by another surface, only the transport edge changes:

```text
dsh Base Host Cordis tree
   ├─ product plugins (agents, tools, skills, persistence, …)
   └─ @openma/deepseek-harness-acp/plugin
         └─ acpServer.connect(Stream)
                │ standard ACP + negotiated extensions
                ▼
          surface-owned Client process
```

The bridge consumes the harness `session/event` firehose — the same
append-only log persistence stores — so live streaming, history replay, and
`session/list` agree by construction. All harness modules, including cordis
itself, load from one host tree: plugin and service identity is never split
across copies.

## Development

```bash
npm install         # dev deps include the harness packages (types + tests)
npm run typecheck   # tsc --noEmit
npm test            # vitest: unit + e2e smoke (boots the real composition; no model calls)
npm run build       # esbuild → dist/
```

To also run the e2e suite against a standalone host install:

```bash
npm install --prefix /tmp/dsh-host @deepseek-ai/dsh
DSH_ACP_TEST_HOST=/tmp/dsh-host npm test
```

### Live iteration: paired profiles

Keep the profile your editor uses on the published package, and point a
second profile at this worktree via a pnpm symlink:

```bash
dsh plugin --profile acp add -w @openma/deepseek-harness-acp   # stable
dsh plugin --profile acp-test add -w "link:$PWD"               # dev (symlink)
```

The dev loop is `npm run build` + restart — `dist/` and `cordis.patch.yml`
are read through the link. (pnpm treats `file:` as a copy install and caches
same-version tarballs; `link:` avoids both.)

```jsonc
{
  "agent_servers": {
    "DeepSeek Harness": { "command": "dsh", "args": ["--profile", "acp"] },
    "DeepSeek Harness (dev)": { "command": "dsh", "args": ["--profile", "acp-test"] }
  }
}
```
