# DSH Conversation Exporter

DSH Conversation Exporter adds an **Export Chat** action to DeepSeek Harness (DSH)
Web. It downloads the current conversation as a clean Markdown file containing the
human-authored messages and final assistant answers, ready for reading, notes, Git, or
handoff to another AI assistant. **Select turns…** optionally exports only chosen whole
conversation turns while preserving the one-click full export.

## Demo

### Export directly from DSH Web

### Clean Markdown output

## Export Chat vs. Session Log

**Export Chat** is an additive action; it does not replace or modify DSH's official
**Session Log** export.

| | Export Chat | Official Session Log |
|---|---|---|
| Purpose | Reading and AI handoff | Debugging, recovery, and replay |
| Contents | Human messages and final assistant answers | Raw events, chunks, tool activity, metadata, and attachments |
| Format | One Markdown file | ZIP of JSONL artifacts and media |

Use **Export Chat** when you want the conversation. Use **Session Log** when you need a
lossless record of how DSH produced it.

## Install and activate

For DSH installations run through `npx @deepseek-ai/dsh`, add the plugin to the `web`
profile:

```bash
npx @deepseek-ai/dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-conversation-exporter
```

Adding the package to the `web` profile activates its host and browser components. If DSH
Web is already running, stop it and restart it so the profile is recomposed:

```bash
npx @deepseek-ai/dsh web
```

## Use

1. Open a conversation in DSH Web.
2. Select **Export Chat** for the whole conversation, or **Select turns…** to choose whole
   Human-plus-final-Assistant turns from a chronological list.
3. If using the selector, all turns start selected. Use **Select all** or **Clear** as
   needed, then choose **Export selected turns**. Export remains disabled when none are
   selected.
4. Your browser downloads `<session-title>--<short-session-id>.md`, for example
   `Project-Architecture-Guide--2002da4d.md`.

The export starts with the final DSH session title as a Markdown H1, uses blockquoted
**Human** and **Assistant** labels, and preserves message Markdown. If one message leaves
a fenced code block open, the exporter closes that fence before the next transcript
section. DSH
internals such as reasoning, tool calls and results, runtime metadata, paths, and token
accounting remain omitted. An unanswered turn is marked with `> Response incomplete.`,
and an image-only human message is retained as `[Image omitted]`.

## Privacy

Exporting is local-only. The plugin reads the selected DSH session through the local DSH
runtime and returns the Markdown to the same local Web application. It has no upload,
cloud storage, telemetry, or analytics path. The repository contains only hand-written,
sanitized test conversations. The selector receives only short previews derived from the
already-filtered conversation—not raw events, reasoning, tools, injected context, DSH
turn ids, or runtime metadata.

## Limitations

- Exports the current session only, in Markdown only.
- Selects whole conversation turns only; Human and Assistant bubbles cannot be selected
  independently.
- Keeps human-authored text and the final assistant answer; attachments, images, reasoning,
  tool activity, injected context, subagent logs, and intermediate responses are omitted.
- Preserves message Markdown verbatim except for a deterministic closing fence added when
  a message otherwise ends inside a fenced code block.
- An image-only human message is represented by `[Image omitted]`; image data is not
  embedded.

## Compatibility

DSH is developer-preview software and its plugin APIs may change. V0.3 targets
`@deepseek-ai/dsh@0.1.0-rc.6`; a later DSH version may require an exporter update.

## Development

Requires Node.js 20 or newer.

To install the plugin from a local checkout for contributor or development testing:

```bash
npx @deepseek-ai/dsh plugin --profile web add .
```

Run the project verification locally:

```bash
npm run verify
```

This runs the complete test suite, JavaScript syntax checks, and an npm package dry-run.
