[![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/dsh-context)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dsh-context)
[![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/bowenliang123/dsh-context?style=social)](https://github.com/bowenliang123/dsh-context)

**The best [DeepSeek Harness plugin](https://www.deepseek.com/harness/) for Agent's context insights and management.**

`dsh-context` provides full context lifecycle management features.
- **Context tab** — an UI context dashboard for DeepSeek Harness’s context stats, composition, history, events, and messages.
- **`/context` command** — the slash command shows the context model for current context composition and recent context evolution.

## Install / Update

To Install from any DeepSeek Harness installation:

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-context
```

Or to update the `dsh-context` plugin:

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web update dsh-context@latest
```

Then start the web UI with `dsh web`. No build step, no restart.

## Use it

### Context tab

Open any session and click the **Context / 上下文** tab:

### ⌨️ `/context` command — In-session Context Insight modal

Type `/context` (or pick it from the `/` menu) and press Enter: a centered dialog shows the provider-anchored occupancy headline, the six-category composition bar, and the last-10-turn trend chart — hover or click a bar for its full breakdown, exactly like the tab.

## What you'll see

### 📊 Context stats — the session at a glance

Turns, steps, how many injections, compactions, and prunes have happened.

### 🧱 Current composition — what's in the window right now

A six-color stacked bar scaled against the model's full context window (the gray track is your remaining headroom): system prompt, tool schemas, your messages, injected context, assistant replies, and tool results — plus the top-5 most expensive tool schemas. When a conversation starts degrading, this is where you find out *which part ate the budget*.

### 📈 History — watch the window grow (and get compacted)

One stacked bar per model request, finer than per-message. Toggle between **Turn** and **Step** granularity, scroll sideways through the session, hover any bar for a quick tooltip, and click to pin the full breakdown — including provider-reported actual prompt/output tokens next to the estimate. **Hovering a bar also drives the Context browser beside it** — the browser previews that step's assembled context in real time as you scrub across the history. **✂ marks where compaction or pruning happened** — watch the bars drop:

Above: a real session that grew to ~563k tokens across 48 turns, then compaction (✂) recycled −535.5k in one step, and the conversation continued from a fresh, small window.

In **Step** granularity, hovering any bar shows that single step's context info instantly — its turn/step, timestamp, and estimated vs. provider-reported token counts:

### ⚡ Context events — when and why the window changed

Every compaction, tool-output prune, skill or plugin context injection, and model switch — each with its token delta, turn/step attribution, and timestamp. Filter by category (**Inject / Compact / Prune / Switch**) to see exactly when each kind of event happened and its impact — e.g. when a skill was injected, when instructions were added, or how much a compaction reclaimed:

### 💬 Messages — the currently model-visible surface

The exact message list the model sees right now, newest first, with a per-message token cost.

### 🧭 Context browser — open the box of any request

Pick **Live (next request)** or any retained step from the picker, and browse what that request was actually assembled from:

![Context browser](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bowenliang123/dsh-context/main/docs/context-browser.png)

Six collapsible category sections (system prompt, tool schemas, user messages, injected context, assistant replies, tool results) expand into one row per element — each with its token price — and every element expands again into its **actual content**: the full system prompt, each tool's description and JSON schema, message text, reasoning, tool-call arguments, and tool outputs.

- **Linked with the history chart** — hover any bar in the History card and the browser previews that step instantly; leave the chart and it returns to your own pick. Keep a category open while scrubbing to compare one category across steps.
- **Honest about coverage** — steps before a compaction are reconstructed from the removed-message archive, and the card says so when a step's makeup is only approximate. Elements older than the loaded chat window page older history in automatically when you expand them, and live injections (AGENTS.md, session-start context, …) are always listed — never a token sum without its items.
