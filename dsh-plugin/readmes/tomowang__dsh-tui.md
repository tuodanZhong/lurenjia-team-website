An open-source terminal front door for [DeepSeek Harness](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness) (`dsh`).

`@tomowang/dsh-tui` is an **out-of-tree mode bundle**: it stacks on `@deepseek-ai/dsh-base` exactly like the shipped `dsh-web-app` and `dsh-headless` bundles do, but drives the agent from your terminal instead of a browser. The package is both a Cordis plugin (terminal input and presentation) and a dsh bundle (`dsh.bundle.patch` in `package.json` points at [`cordis.patch.yml`](cordis.patch.yml)); everything else — model adapters, tools, session persistence, sandbox and approval policy — stays in `dsh-base` and remains patchable underneath.

## How it works

- The TUI renders **only from the durable session log**: it replays `agent.session.events` on startup and follows `session/event` live, so `--resume` shows the exact history the log carries — the harness's "model-visible ⟺ logged" invariant does the heavy lifting.
- Line input maps to the agent inbox: `agent.followup()` while idle, `agent.steer()` while a turn is running, `Ctrl+C` cancels the running turn.
- `tui-startup` parses this app's flags (everything after the launcher's own) through `dsh-cmdline` and publishes them as an ordinary Cordis service; the runner row reads them via the bundle patch, mirroring `dsh-headless`.
- Both stdin and stdout must be real TTYs; the plugin fails loud instead of degrading, so pipes keep using `dsh --profile headless`.

## Features

- **Status bar** — session id, active LLM provider/model, current agent preset, live run state with spinner, queued-message count, and logged event count.
- **Stats line** — turn/step counts, LLM/tool wall time, TTFT and decode tok/s, cache-hit %, billed tokens, and a compact context-usage summary; sections hide themselves until there's data.
- **`/model` provider management** — switch the active model, and add, edit, or delete custom LLM providers (route, base URL, API key, model discovery) without leaving the terminal.
- **Agent presets** — start a fresh session on a given preset with `--agent-preset`, or browse and switch presets from `/presets` (fixed once the session's first turn has run).
- **Session inspectors** — `/trajectory` for a turn/step event ledger with a detail view and filtering, `/context` for a context-window usage breakdown, `/plugins` for the loaded Cordis plugin tree and fiber state.
- **Tool Cards overlay** — `/tools` or `Ctrl+O` opens a scrollable browser over the session's tool calls/results, letting a card expand past the transcript's fixed line cap to its full presentation instead of showing "…omitted".
- **Reasoning display** — a model's reasoning/thinking content renders as a distinct dim `✦ thinking` block ahead of its visible answer, both while streaming and in settled transcript output.
- **Markdown rendering** — assistant text with an unambiguous Markdown signal (fenced code, headers, lists, blockquotes, rules, tables, links, bold/strikethrough, inline code) is styled for the terminal; plain prose passes through untouched.
- **Permission preset cycling** — `Shift+Tab` cycles `read-only` / `workspace-write` / `danger-full-access` / `custom`, shown live in the prompt area.
- **In-terminal approvals and questions** — a tool call parked on an `ask` permission decision is answered right in the terminal (allow once / reject), and `ask_user_question`/plan-mode's plan review present as an option list with multi-select and free-text "Other…", `esc` to skip.
- **Manual compaction** — `/compact` summarizes and compacts session history on demand.
- **Persisted prompt history** — submitted lines are saved across processes and `/clear`, recalled with `↑`/`↓`.
- **Readline-style input** — word/line motion, kill/yank-style deletes, multi-line drafts, and shell-like double-press `Ctrl+C`/`Ctrl+D` to exit.
- **Shell mode** — a leading `!` on an empty prompt (Claude Code's convention) switches Enter to run the line as a local shell command instead of sending it to the agent; the prompt border turns yellow for the duration, and output streams into the transcript without touching the session log.
- **`@`-file-mention autocomplete** — typing `@` opens a fuzzy-filtered dropdown of repo files (`git ls-files`, or a bounded walk outside a git repo); `Tab`/`Enter` inserts the picked path at the cursor.
- Every overlay degrades to a plain notice instead of failing the whole TUI when its backing service isn't mounted in a given profile.

## Install

Requires Node `^22.19 || >=24` and a `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`.

```sh
# 1. Install the dsh launcher
npm install -g @deepseek-ai/dsh

# 2. Create the profile and install this bundle into it
#    (dsh reconciles the profile manifest's "dsh.profile.bundles" list
#    automatically, appending any installed dependency that declares
#    dsh.bundle.patch — no manual package.json edit needed)
dsh plugin --profile tui add @tomowang/dsh-tui

# 3. Run
dsh --profile tui
dsh --profile tui --resume <sessionId>           # reopen a persisted session
dsh --profile tui --agent-preset <presetId>      # start a fresh session on a given preset
dsh --profile tui --dump-config                  # inspect the composed plugin tree
```

Any row `--dump-config` prints — the model adapter, tool set, sandbox policy, this TUI's own config — can be overridden from the profile's `cordis.patch.yml` without touching this package. `--agent-preset` is a `dsh`-launcher flag (parsed by `tui-startup`, not `--dump-config` above) that only applies to a fresh session; it's ignored together with `--resume`, and is a no-op with a startup notice on profiles that don't mount `dsh-agent-presets`.

## Terminal commands

| Input | Effect |
|---|---|
| any text | follow-up while idle, steering while a turn runs |
| `/help` | show available commands and keyboard shortcuts |
| `/model` | manage LLM provider profiles: switch model, add/edit/delete a custom provider |
| `/presets` | view and switch agent presets (fixed once the session's first turn has run) |
| `/trajectory` | browse the turn/step event ledger with a detail inspector and filter |
| `/tools` | browse and expand tool cards past the transcript's line cap |
| `/context` | show context-window usage as a bar-chart breakdown |
| `/plugins` | show the loaded Cordis plugin tree and fiber state |
| `/compact` | summarize and compact session history |
| `/clear` | flush the current session and start a new one |
| `/exit`, `/quit` | cancel, wait for idle, flush the session, exit |

### Keyboard shortcuts

| Key | Effect |
|---|---|
| `Ctrl+C` | cancel a running turn; on an idle empty line, press twice within 2s to exit |
| `Ctrl+D` | forward-delete; on an idle empty line, press twice within 2s to exit |
| `Shift+Tab` | cycle the permission preset (`read-only` / `workspace-write` / `danger-full-access` / `custom`) |
| `Ctrl+O` | open the Tool Cards overlay; `↑`/`↓` select a card, `Enter`/`Space` expand or collapse, `PgUp`/`PgDn`/`Home`/`End` scroll an expanded card, `Esc`/`q`/`Ctrl+O` close |
| `!` (on an empty prompt) | enter shell mode: Enter runs the line as a local shell command; `Esc`/backspace-on-empty exits back to normal mode |
| `@` | open the file-mention dropdown; `↑`/`↓` to move, `Tab`/`Enter` to insert the path, `Esc` to dismiss |
| `Tab` | in `/command` mode, autocomplete the highlighted command |
| `↑` / `↓`, `Ctrl+P` / `Ctrl+N` | recall prompt history, or move within a multi-line draft |
| `Shift+Enter`, `Alt+Enter`, trailing `\` + `Enter` | insert a newline instead of submitting |
| `Home`/`Ctrl+A`, `End`/`Ctrl+E`, `Ctrl+B`/`Ctrl+F`/arrows | readline-style character and line motion |
| `Alt+Left`/`Alt+Right`, `Ctrl+Left`/`Ctrl+Right` | move by word |
| `Ctrl+K`/`Ctrl+U`, `Ctrl+W`/`Alt+Backspace`, `Alt+D` | kill to line end/start, kill word back/forward |

## Develop

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm run build        # tsc → lib/
pnpm run typecheck
pnpm run lint
pnpm run test
```

To try a local checkout inside a profile, point the profile's dependency at this directory (`dsh plugin --profile tui add /path/to/dsh-tui`) and rebuild before each run — profiles load the built `lib/` under plain Node.

### Releasing

`CHANGELOG.md` and GitHub Release notes are generated from Conventional Commits via [git-cliff](https://git-cliff.org/). To cut a release: bump `version` in `package.json`, run `pnpm run changelog`, commit as `chore(release): vX.Y.Z`, then `git tag vX.Y.Z && git push && git push --tags`. The tag push triggers CI to build, create the GitHub Release, and publish to npm. See [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md#releasing) for the full flow.
